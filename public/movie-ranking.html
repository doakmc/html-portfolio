<h1>The Best Movies According to Mazza</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Aliens</h3>
<p>I was about 15 or 16 years old when I first saw this film, and I remember how totally engrossed I was.  It blew me away.  Absolutely loved the action and that feeling has stuck with me since.</p>
<h3>The Blind Side</h3>
<p>A truly excellent film with amazing performances from everyone in it.  Based on a true story, Sandra Bullock deserved her oscar for her perforamce.</p>
<h3>Star Wars - A New Hope</h3>
<p>To be honest, any of the original three Star Wars movies could have been listed here, 
   but the first one was ground breaking for it's time.  A classic that I still happily watch with my son.
